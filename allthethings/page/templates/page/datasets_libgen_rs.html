        The quick story of the different Library Genesis (or “Libgen”) forks, is that over time, the different people involved with Library Genesis had a falling out, and went their separate ways.

        <li class="list-disc">The “.fun" version was created by the original founder. It is being revamped in favor of a new, more distributed version.</li>
        <li class="list-disc">The “.rs” version has very similar data, and most consistently releases their collection in bulk torrents. It is roughly split into a “fiction” and a “non-fiction” section.</li>
        <li class="list-disc">The <a href="/datasets/libgen_li">“.li” version</a> has a massive collection of comics, as well as other content, that is not (yet) available for bulk download through torrents. It also contains the metadata of Sci-Hub in its database.</li>
        <li class="list-disc"><a href="/datasets/zlib_scrape">Z-Library</a> in some sense is also a fork of Library Genesis, though they used a different name for their project.</li>

      <p class="mb-4">
        This page is about the “.rs” version. It is known for consistently publishing both its metadata and the full contents of its book catalog. Its book collection is split between a fiction and non-fiction portion.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-4">
        They also helped create torrents for the Sci-Hub project, a large collection of academic papers. This collection is also called “scimag”. The torrents for the contents are hosted by the Libgen.rs, though the metadata itself is hosted on the Sci-Hub website. Note that the <a href="/datasets/libgen_li">Libgen.li</a> metadata also contains the Sci-Hub metadata.
